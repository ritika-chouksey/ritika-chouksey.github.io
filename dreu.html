          For the summer of 2019, I worked with <a href="https://dritchie.github.io">Dr. Daniel Ritchie</a> at
          Brown University. His broad research focus is in the intersection of computer graphics with artificial
          intelligence and machine learning. Our project focused on training a (1) a large 3D dataset of furniture and movable parts that uses an active learning component to suggest annotations on similiar yet novel data  (2) computer vision task which can take an
          incomplete point cloud representation of a scene and predict which parts of which objects in that scene can be
          interacted with and how they can move.

    <h2 id="week">Week 1: June 3rd - 7th</h2>

    <p>Upon moving in and meeting my mentor as well as the research team, I was given an in-depth introduction to
      the current project and research efforts that have been developed over the past year. Also, learned that there
      was one week left to meet the International Conference on 3D Vision June 10th paper deadline. The gist of the
      project is that we further segment existing 3D models into individual components and provide an initial seed
      or batch of manual kinematic annotations which are then used in conjunction with Geometric Sampling and
      shallow Machine Learning algorithms to suggest possible new kinematic annotations. In conjunction with my
      first week in the lab, I had several social events to attend for another summer program that I am apart of at
      Brown. Thus far, I am enjoying my time here and look forward to the weeks to come. </p>

    <h2 id="week">Week 2: June 10th - 14th</h2>

    <p>The entire research team worked through the weekend to meet the deadline for 3DV. It was rather intense yet
      rewarding at the same time. I feel more comfortable communicating with my mentor and others in the lab. Once we
      met our deadline, my mentor let us rest and take it easy for the next few days. We convened later in the week to
      discuss action items to polish our current work and also met with a PhD student from another lab to discuss a
      potential collaboration with his work and our current dataset. Although things have slowed down, between reviewing
      literature suggest by mentor as well as the PhD student and action items there is still plenty to do. I am beyond
      pleased to be apart of this lab and learn from everyone here.</p>

    <p>This week was a rather different shift since all
      the PI’s were attending CVPR. Our group still conducting our weekly meeting and continued with wrap up work on
      evaluations and next steps of our publication. There was also a new member, fellow undergraduate, in the lab for
      the summer. I and another member spent some time helping the new member get caught up to speed.</p>

    <p>First full week without any PIs, they all were on
      vacation. I become a little anxious and felt a little lost when thinking about what would make the most since to
      take on next. With some helpful advice from a grad student began reading related literature in hopes to formulate
      a problem statement to dicuss with my mentor upon his return</p>

    <p>This week marked the second week of all the PIs
      being away on vacation. I took this opportunity to change scenary and spent a week working remotely in Toronto.
      The isolated and new environment gave me the ability to focus rigorously on reading and formalizing my notes into
      a draft problem statement. I also continued working on our stk codebase, mainly focusing on evaluations. I also
      spent a few hours helping a PhD student annotate some last minute data for a deadline.</p>

    <p>Quite a bit has happened this week. Firstly, I
      finalized formalizing my notes and ideas into a draft problem statement. My mentor advised me to be less
      exhaustive in my writing (e.g citing anything tangentially relevant), and also be more thoughtful in the overall
      narrative that I convey. Taking him up on his advice, I took advantage of the writing center and prepared for our
      meeting with a Ph.D. collaborator the following day. With a more refined problem statement/outline, I was able to
      more effectively convey my ideas across allowing us to move forward with conducting meaningful research. Being
      that my time here is nearing an end, we also discussed how to best utilize the time as well as the resources we
      have available. We agreed that due to the conflicting time frame and the potential opportunity to present at a
      more focused venue with more polished contributions, I will not be participating in the two undergraduate summer
      research symposiums that take place at Brown.</p>

    <p>Being the first week of my actual project, I
      dedicated the bulk of my time to getting an initial pipeline set up. Spent quite a bit of time coding together a
      set of scripts to leverage existing libraries as well as our stk codebase. To my delight this gave me the
      opportunity to become one with the data and understand the pipeline. Our first formal meeting on this project
      raised question and a series of initial assumptions to keep in mind. Also to my dismay, I often have a bad habit
      of sticking my foot in my mouth when explaining my research. So these days I am getting much practice at
      communicating my ideas.</p>

    <p>I failed to mention but I am also in another summer
      program here at Brown, the Leadership Alliance to be exact. As such we traveled and presented at a National
      Symposium in Hartford, CT. As one of the only computer science students in this program, I was not looking forward
      to this. I gave an initial presentation with very basic power point slides to my grad student mentor and it did
      not go well. Thankfully she had a series of tips and advice on presenting. Structurally, my presentation needed a
      few tweaks but it terms of visuals, engaging the audience outside my discipline and pacing I had much work to do.
      I had the chance to get in another practice session the night before with a few friends and add the finishing gifs
      to my presentation the day of. To my surprise many people enjoying and appreciated my high level yet engaging
      presentation.</p>

    <p>This week marks the end of the Leadership Alliance
      program here at Brown and it shows for my schedule has been inconsistent with events, deadlines and various other
      social gatherings. There was another venue we had to give a presentation at and to my dismay it was a poster
      session. This boiled down to me ignoring my presentation obligations and spending the bulk of my down time doing
      actual research. This went fine until the night before were, my employed adhoc strategy of spending 20 minutes
      between work blocks completing my poster yielded little progress. Further complicating things, as I usual do, I
      decided to use Adobe Illustrator which I am new to. This resulted in me staying up all night to finish the poster
      and printing it out the morning of the session.</p>

    <p>My last in final week in Providence, things went in
      a similar manner as the previous two weeks. Rather busy handling logistics, meetings and social gatherings. This
      does not bother me as my PI and I have agreed to continue work on both projects when I return home. Looking back,
      I can confidently say that this city has yet to grow on me. However, the people that I have meet here have been
      and have had the pleasure of working with or attending church have left a great impression. Words cannot express
      the gratitude that I have for my mentor, staff at Brown, as well as individual who support the Leadership Alliance
      and CRW-A DREU programs for this insightful, unpredictable and cultivating summer experience.</p>
